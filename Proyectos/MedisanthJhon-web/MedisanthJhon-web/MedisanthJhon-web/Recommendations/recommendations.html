        <h2>Depression in the elderly, how to deal with it</h2>

            Depression is one of the most frequent causes of outpatient care, and the group of older adults is not excluded from suffering from this disease.
            As they age, people go through many changes in their 
            lifestyles and environment, such as retirement, stressful life events, financial difficulties, medical problems (chronic diseases and disabilities), the death of loved ones and of the spouse , or leave the home in which you have lived for many years.
            It's normal to feel restless, stressed, or sad about these changes, but after the adjustment phase, many older people feel good again.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text">
            Depression is different; it is a medical problem that affects daily life and normal functioning. It is not a common part of aging, nor is it a sign of weakness or a character flaw.
            Some older adults are more likely to have depression. Among the factors that increase these possibilities include: being female, not being married or having lost a partner; not having friends or family who can support them, medical history such as heart attack, cerebrovascular disease or hip fracture; people with chronic pain, those who drink alcoholic beverages in large quantities, those in nursing homes, and those with a history of depression earlier in life.
            In some older adults, depression can be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, because sadness is not the main symptom, since they can present other, less obvious symptoms, which can go unnoticed if a careful questioning is not made or they do not want to talk about feelings.
            Among the symptoms of depression that may be different in older adults, we have:</p> 
            <br>
            Memory problems
            Changes in personality
            Exacerbation or appearance of physical pain
            Fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep disturbances
            Isolation (wanting to stay home often, rather than going out to socialize)
            Suicidal thoughts or feelings
            You have to be very careful with these suicidal ideas, especially in men.
            <p class="text">
                One of the best things older adults can
                 do to maintain healthy aging and prevent depression is to stay active; 
                 join groups of older adults where various group activities are carried out
                 The evaluation and proper management of depression in older adults is very important, since, 
                 due to the cognitive alterations that can occur, it can be misdiagnosed as a dementia disorder, whose management and prognosis is very different.
